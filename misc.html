				<h2>track & field</h2>
				<h4>ncaa division I sprinter/jumper<h4>
				<p>A dedicated student athlete must accel in time management. Putting in roughly 12+ hours of practice a week and forcing myself to wake up for 7am lifts, I must find time to complete my work while still getting enough sleep. </p>
				<p id="second-track">Though sprint workouts are painful and balancing my schedule is tiring, the close friends I made along the way and the reward of achieving a personal best makes it all worth it.</p>

				<p>I have been playing piano for as long as I can remember. I used to dread going to the weekly practices, However, I now use piano as a stress reliever. I was able to audition for and peform at Carnegie Hall five times. Aside from piano, I dappled with cello and guitar and am an avid spotify playlist creator. I am constantly listening to music. My friend and I even have our own radio show at Colgate!</p>

				<p>I have been very fortunate to travel on a yearly basis, but by far, the most eye-opening and rewarding experience was my volunteer trip to Livingstone, Zambia. Travelling with a few of my closest college mates, I taught English and Math to second graders at under-resourced schools.</p>
